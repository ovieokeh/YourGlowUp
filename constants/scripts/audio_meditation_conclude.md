As this meditation practice comes to a close, gently bring your awareness back to the feeling of your body as a whole. Notice the support of the surface beneath you.

Become aware again of the sounds around you, without letting them disturb your inner calm. Take a slightly deeper breath in... and a full breath out.

Carry any sense of peace or stillness with you as you prepare to re-engage with your day. When you feel ready, you can begin to introduce some gentle movement.

Perhaps wiggle your fingers and toes. Maybe slowly stretch in any way that feels good.

And in your own time, when you're ready, gently open your eyes. Thank you for sharing this practice.
