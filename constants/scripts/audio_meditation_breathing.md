Now, bring your awareness gently to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your inhales and exhales, without trying to change anything at all.

Simply observe the sensation of the breath as it enters your body... and as it leaves. Perhaps you feel the air at the tip of your nostrils... cool as it comes in... slightly warmer as it goes out.

Or maybe you notice the gentle rise and fall of your chest... or your abdomen. Just rest your attention on wherever you feel the breath most clearly.

If your mind wanders, as it naturally will, just gently acknowledge where it went... and then softly guide your attention back to your breath. No judgment... no frustration. This is simply the nature of the mind, and part of the practice.

Each time you bring your mind back, you are strengthening your ability to focus and be present. Breathing in... and breathing out.

Allowing the breath to be your anchor to this present moment. Feeling the life-giving energy of the inhale... and the gentle release of the exhale.

Notice the subtle pauses that might occur between breaths... a moment of stillness. Continue to follow the natural, easy rhythm of your breathing. In... and out.

With each exhale, imagine you are letting go of any tension you might be holding. Feeling a little more settled... a little more calm with each complete breath cycle.

If thoughts or sounds arise, simply notice them as passing events in your awareness... like clouds drifting across the sky... and gently, without force, return your focus to the sensation of breathing. There's no need to engage with them... just let them be. Your breath is always here for you to return to, a constant and steady presence.

Just a little longer now... staying with the breath. Simply being with your breath... in this quiet moment.
