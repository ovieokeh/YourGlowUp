Now, we'll move into a body scan, bringing gentle, curious awareness to different parts of your body, without judgment. Let your breath continue to flow naturally in the background.

Begin by bringing your attention to your feet. Notice your toes. Can you feel each toe individually? Sense any sensations here – warmth, coolness, tingling, pressure, or perhaps no particular sensation at all. Just notice what's present.

Now, bring your awareness to the soles of your feet... the heels... the tops of your feet... and your ankles. Simply observe any feelings or sensations in your entire feet and ankles.

Gently allow your awareness to travel up into your lower legs... your shins and your calves. Notice the contact your calves might be making with the surface beneath you. Are there any feelings of tension or relaxation here? Just acknowledge whatever you find.

Now, let your attention move to your knees... the front, the back, the sides of your knees. What do you notice here? Holding this area in your gentle awareness.

Continue upwards, bringing your focus to your thighs... the large muscles of your upper legs. Feel their weight, their presence. Notice any sensations from the surface of your skin to deep within the muscle.

Now, bring your awareness to your hips and pelvis... the entire pelvic bowl. Notice the points of contact with your seat if you are sitting. This area often holds tension. See if you can soften and release, just a little, with your out-breath.

Let your attention travel up into your abdomen... your stomach area. Notice the gentle rise and fall here as you breathe. Be aware of any sensations within your belly – perhaps softness, or tightness, or gurgling. It's all okay.

Move your awareness to your lower back... and then slowly up your spine, vertebra by vertebra, to your mid-back... and your upper back. Are there areas of tension or ease? Simply observe.

Bring your attention to your chest area... your rib cage expanding and softening with each breath. Notice your heartbeat, if you can feel it – steady and calm. Holding this area with kindness.

Now, let your awareness flow into your shoulders. Shoulders often carry a lot of burden. See if you can allow them to soften, to drop a little further away from your ears. Just a gentle invitation to release.

Let this awareness travel down your arms... your upper arms... your elbows... your forearms... your wrists... and into your hands. Notice your hands. Feel your palms... the backs of your hands... each finger and thumb. Are your hands warm or cool? Heavy or light? Just observing.

Now, bring your attention to your neck... the back of your neck, the sides, the front. Another area where tension can accumulate. Invite a sense of softness here if you can.

And finally, bring your awareness to your head. Notice your jaw – is it clenched? See if you can allow it to be soft. Your lips... your cheeks... your nose... your ears. Your eyes, resting gently behind your eyelids. Your forehead – perhaps allow it to smooth out. And the crown of your head. Holding your entire head in this gentle, accepting awareness.

Now, for a few moments, be aware of your whole body, from the tips of your toes to the top of your head... breathing... present... alive. Just resting in this awareness of your whole body.
