Welcome to your meditation practice.

Find a comfortable position, either sitting upright with a straight yet relaxed spine, or lying down if that feels better for you today.
Gently allow your eyes to close, or maintain a soft, unfocused gaze downwards.

Take a moment to settle in. There's nothing else you need to do right now, nowhere else you need to be. Just be here.
